# ðŸ“Š 3. Machine Learning Project (Predictive Maintenance)

 ðŸ“Š Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning

A machine learning model for predicting equipment failures based on sensor data. The Predictive Maintenance Project applies machine learning to anticipate equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

This project uses real or synthetic sensor datasets (temperature, vibration, pressure, RPM, etc.) to:
 - Train models to detect early warning signs of equipment degradation.
 - Classify whether a machine is operating normally or approaching failure.
 - Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using regression models.
 - Visualize failure probabilities and maintenance recommendations.

It demonstrates how mechanical engineering knowledge of systems can be combined with software/ML techniques to solve real industrial challenges.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Preprocessing of time-series sensor data.
- Feature engineering for predictive maintenance.
- Classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
